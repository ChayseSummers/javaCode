Assignment 2 - Reflections

	After having completed fixing the errors throughout the brokenCalculator file, I started testing out different
conditions to make sure that the program was working properly. Everything seems fine so long as you input in the valid
format. I noticed when using a printf statement to output the results, the very small numbers do not get displayed
properly. I don't know of anyway to tell it to figure out how many decimal places are needed and to output that in a
printf statement, printf seems only capable of rounding digits to a specified number of places with the default being six
places past the decimal. Because of this, it looks like using a non-printf statement to display the results is best. In
the future I may try debugging by writing out every step I take.When I first did this assignment, I forgot to mark where
the bugs where and ended up having to do it again. Keeping track of the bugs should help to show why other parts of the
program aren't running properly, if they aren't running properly, during testing. 

results:
Your expression: .000000009 + .00000000008
0.0000000090 + 0.000000 = 0.000000 (Using printf with the first expression set to %.10f, second to %s, third to %f and result to %f.)
9.0E-9 + 8.0E-11 = 9.08E-9 (Using already coded in print statement.)

Your expression: 2 + 2
2.0 + 2.0 = 4.0

Your expression: 2 - 2
2.0 - 2.0 = 0.0

Your expression: -2 + -2
-2.0 + -2.0 = -4.0

Your expression: -2 / -2
-2.0 / -2.0 = 1.0

Your expression: -2 - -2
-2.0 - -2.0 = 0.0

Your expression: -2 ^ 2
-2.0 ^ 2.0 = 4.0

Your expression: .0000006 + .0000007
6.0E-7 + 7.0E-7 = 1.2999999999999998E-6

Your expression: -2 * 2
-2.0 * 2.0 = -4.0

Your expression: -2 * -2
-2.0 * -2.0 = 4.0
