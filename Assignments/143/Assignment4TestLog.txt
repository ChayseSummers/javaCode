Work Summary:

This was quite the complex program. I fell very confident in my abilities after getting this program to work how I'd like it to. Some issues I encountered involved getting the output to save correctly, in the right format, catching exceptions and handling bad input from user. Other than those a lack of time was one of the main challenges. Not that we didn't have enough time from when this was assigned as much as I wasn't able to get as much done prior to the due date as I would have liked to. I added a feature that lets the user see how many books are currently in the catalog. This was fun, I had a great time in CSC143. Thanks for everything!
