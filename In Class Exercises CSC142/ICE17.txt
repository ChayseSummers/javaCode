Write a method called appendArrays that accepts two integer arrays as parameters and returns a new array that contains 
the result of appending the second array’s values at the end of the first array.

For example, if arrays list1 and list2 store [2, 4, 6] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] respectively, the call of appendArrays 
(list1, list2) should return a new array containing [2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

If the call instead had been appendArrays (list2, list1), the method would return an array containing 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 4, 6].
