Weekly Problem 2:

A useful technique for catching typing errors is to use a check digit.

For example, International Article Number 13 (EAN 13) uses the last digit (also known as checkdigit) to validate the correctness of the first 12 digits.

For more info on EAN13, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number_(EAN) (Links to an external site.)

If EAN13 is 4006381333931  the check code is computed as follows:
Calculation First 12 digits of the barcode 	4 	0 	0 	6 	3 	8 	1 	3 	3 	3 	9 	3
Weights 					1 	3 	1 	3 	1 	3 	1 	3 	1 	3 	1 	3
Multiplied by weight 				4 	0 	0 	18 	3 	24 	1 	9 	3 	9 	9 	9
Sum 																	89

The nearest multiple of 10 that is equal or higher than the sum, is 90. Subtract them: 90 - 89 = 1, this is the last digit of the barcode.

Write a Java program that asks the user for a EAN13 and validates it as either correct or incorrect. Use all validation techniques including handling exceptions in code.
